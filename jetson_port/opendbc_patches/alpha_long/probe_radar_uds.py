"""Find out why the Mazda radar never answers the programming-session request.

The handshake in longitudinal.py reports only success/failure, and
IsoTpParallelQuery discards anything that is not the exact positive response it
is waiting for. So a NEGATIVE response -- the radar saying "no, and here is why"
-- looks identical to silence. This dumps everything instead.

WHAT IT SENDS. Only the three frames the panda's own safety model permits to
0x764 (mazda.h: tester present, and session control for default/programming).
Security access, routine control and memory writes are rejected in the firmware
by design, so this cannot reflash or reconfigure the radar. Suppression is
reversible on its own: stop tester-present and the radar times out back to
stock, and an ignition cycle always restores it.

HOW TO RUN. Stop dashcam_web first -- this needs exclusive /dev/ttyACM0.
Car stationary, wheels chocked, ignition on, engine running, MRCC MAIN on.

    sudo python3 probe_radar_uds.py

Then paste the output back.
