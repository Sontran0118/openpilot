"""STANDARD +10 mph target with a coast band to +15 -- no brake-check at the top.

Two things are being checked, and they are separate:

  1. speed_target.SpeedTarget puts the TARGET at limit + 10 mph in STANDARD and
     limit + 15 mph in MADS, so STANDARD can never sit above MADS.
  2. govern_accel stops giving throttle AT the target but does not brake until
     the coast band above it is crossed.

Runs against the real functions, not a reimplementation. No CAN, no car.
