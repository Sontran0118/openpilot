"""Phone-viewable dashboard for the dashcam run.

Serves on 0.0.0.0:8080 using only the stdlib (no flask on this box):
  /            live page: MJPEG video + calibration convergence + car state
  /stream.mjpg motion-JPEG of what the MODEL sees
  /status.json machine-readable state (also what the page polls)

Runs the same pipeline as dashcam.py -- panda read-only in SAFETY_SILENT, real
CAN -> carState, camera -> supercombo -> curvature -> modelV2 -> controlsd -- and
adds the view layer so you can watch calibration converge from the phone instead
of guessing after the fact.

The calibration panel is the point: rpy is fed from the model's pose odometry and
ONLY updates while the car is moving, so if it stays at 0,0,0 the drive is not
producing usable data and you can see that immediately rather than at the end.

Usage:  python3 dashcam_web.py [--port 8080] [--no-daemons] [--arm]

ARMING (real transmit):
  By default the panda is held in SAFETY_SILENT and NOTHING is transmitted --
  this is the dashcam behaviour. Passing --arm (or DASHCAM_ARM=1 in the env)
  switches the panda to the Mazda safety model and streams the real
  0x243 CAM_LKAS steering frame at 70 Hz, built from the same torque controlsd
  produces. The panda firmware's Mazda safety hooks are the hardware net: they
  only pass a steering frame when the car reports cruise engaged (controls
  allowed) and clamp torque/rate to the Mazda limits (800 / 10up / 25down),
  exactly as validated by override_test2.py. Read the arming banner before use.

# OP_MPC=1 replaces govern_accel's clamp with openpilot's real longitudinal MPC.
#
# WHY. govern_accel is a BOUND, not a plan: it sees one number (the model action
# head's current desired accel), limits its size and how fast it may change, and
# passes it on. It has no horizon, so it cannot anticipate anything -- approaching
# a slower car it keeps commanding accel until the gap check trips, then cuts.
# That is the surging you feel.
#
# The MPC solves a constrained optimisation over a 13-step horizon each cycle:
# it predicts how speed and accel evolve, penalises jerk and closing on the lead,
# respects hard accel/jerk limits, and applies only the first step. Because it
# re-plans every cycle it starts easing off SECONDS before it needs to.
#
# acados (the solver) ships prebuilt for aarch64 in comma-deps-acados and was
# already installed; the generated solver was built into
# longitudinal_mpc_lib/c_generated_code/acados_ocp_solver_pyx.so.
#
# CRUISE TARGET. Upstream takes v_cruise from the set speed. Under MADS there is
# no set-speed concept, so the speed cap doubles as the cruise target: the MPC is
# asked to reach V_MAX_KPH and no more. OP_V_TARGET_KPH overrides it.
#
# govern_accel still runs AFTER the MPC as a safety clamp. The MPC should produce
# sane values, but a bound costs nothing and keeps the lead/speed/jerk caps as a

        # A recv and a send together (13.5 ms) fit inside the period with room

        # stream than 50 Hz -- 61% of one-second windows in the 30-39 ms band
        # and 168 starvation escapes in a minute.
        #
        # The reason is that "does it fit before the next deadline" is the wrong
        # question. By the time can_thread asks, the send has already consumed
        # part of the period, so the remaining slack (12.8 ms) is smaller than a
        # recv plus any margin -- and it only ever shrinks as the deadline
        # approaches. The condition can never become true, so the recv waits out
        # the 250 ms escape and lands on top of a send anyway.

        # The right question is WHEN to start, and the answer does not depend on
        # any measurement: immediately after a send is the moment of maximum
        # slack, always. So wait for the send, then go. One recv per send, rx
        # rate equals tx rate, no starvation possible while tx is running, and

        # target down to ~28 Hz before. Irregularity is the thing the EPS faults

        # inside the period and produced the 30-39 ms holes in 25% of one-second
        # windows. The link scheduler in can_thread now places the recv in the
        # gap before the next tx deadline rather than merely deferring it, so the

        WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE THREAD FROM tx_thread. The 0x243 stream is the one
        thing on this board with a hard regularity requirement -- the EPS faults
        LKAS on irregular frames, and tx_thread's rate, its link scheduler and its
        rejection-resync are all tuned around that. Longitudinal runs at 50 Hz with
        no such constraint, so it gets its own loop and tx_thread is left exactly as
        it was rather than being taught a second cadence.

        WHY IT DRIVES THE REAL CarController. The stop-and-go sequence in
        carcontroller.py -- five CRZ_CTRL profiles, the hold latch, the passive-hold
        substate, the resume unlatch phases -- is what took the community from
        "longitudinal works" (2026-03) to "stop and go works" (2026-04). It is
        stateful and the states are not guessable. Reimplementing it here to fit
        this process's data shapes would be rewriting the only part that is known
        good, so instead the real controller runs and only its longitudinal frames
        are taken; the LKAS/HUD frames it also builds are DISCARDED, because

        Alpha long silences the radar to take over 0x21b/0x21c, but the radar also
        sends 0x361-0x366 and 0x499, which we do NOT replace. Those simply vanish,
        and the forward camera -- which normally receives them -- is the module
        that reports "front camera sensor" on the cluster.

        Silencing it more politely is not an option: MEASURED 2026-08-09, this
        radar refuses CommunicationControl (0x28) and both the extended and
        safety-system diagnostic sessions, answering none of them, while accepting
        the programming session instantly. So the radar goes fully mute whatever we
        do, and the only remaining lever is to put its other frames back ourselves.

        Replay is only credible because these frames carry NO CHECKSUM. Five have a
        4-bit counter in the low nibble of byte 7 and two are static, so a replayed
        frame is indistinguishable from a real one except for its CONTENT, which is
        frozen at whatever the radar last said before it went quiet.

        THAT IS THE PART THAT MAY NOT WORK, and it is worth being honest about:
        0x361 carries DISTANCE_LEAD and RELATIVE_VEL_LEAD. If the camera checks
        those against its own vision, a frozen lead that never moves is exactly the
        kind of implausibility a sensor-fusion check exists to catch, and we will
        have traded one fault for another. Capture with nothing ahead if you can --
        a "no target" snapshot is the least likely to contradict anything.

            # alive. Two reasons:
            #
            #   - If the car is already awake at launch, "0x202 is present" is true
            #     immediately and we would suppress in the same after-the-fact way
            #     that has produced the fault every time so far. The edge is the
            #     whole point.
            #
            #   - Launching against a DEAD bus is its own trap: CAN1 cannot leave
            #     initialisation without traffic, so the core wedges and 0x202 never
            #     arrives even after the key turns. Starting on a live bus and
            #     riding through a key cycle avoids that entirely.
            #
            # So: OP_SUPPRESS_AT_IGNITION=1, start the stack with the engine
            # RUNNING, then cycle the key. We watch 0x202 stop, then start, and fire
