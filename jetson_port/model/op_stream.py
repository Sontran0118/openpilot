# --- which driving model -----------------------------------------------------
# Default is "Rebellious Hope" (commaai/openpilot #38475, 2026-07-27), the current
# weights for any device without comma's USB GPU accessory. It differs from the
# model this port started on in two ways that matter here:
#
#   1. It emits an `action` head -- the steering and acceleration command itself,
#      as a trained output. Before, modeld reconstructed both from the plan's yaw
#      and speed columns. See curvature_lib.DirectAction.
#   2. It reordered every output field (lane_lines 117 -> 0, hidden_state
#      1064 -> 2066) and grew the vector 2576 -> 2580. Nothing here holds a
#      literal offset -- the layout is read from the ONNX's output_slices
#      metadata -- but an engine paired with the WRONG ONNX would decode lane
#      lines as the plan and never raise, so __init__ checks the two agree.
#
# Both are fp16 engines. fp32 is kept only as a numerical reference; on this board
# the fp16 build runs ~4.7x faster (4.5 ms vs 21.1 ms) for the same weights, which
# is the difference between having and not having headroom at 20 Hz.

#
# LATERAL: 0.10 -> 0.20. The 0.10 was lagd's initial_lag for MAZDA_CX5_2022 -- a
# fleet default, not this rack. The real number was MEASURED on this CX-5
# (2026-07-30, 10.3k records above 20 kph) by cross-correlating LKAS_REQUEST
# against LKAS_EFFECTIVE inside 0x241, which carries both in the SAME frame and
# so isolates the rack's own lag from anything our CAN pipeline contributes:
# peak r=0.887 at lag 4 records = 200 ms. See opendbc_src interface.py, which
# already carries 0.2, and latcontrol_torque.py's JERK_GAIN note.
#
# THIS FILE WAS THE HALF THAT WAS LEFT BEHIND. The controller side was already
# correct: dashcam_web publishes liveDelay.lateralDelay = CP.steerActuatorDelay
# (0.2), so LatControlTorque picks the right past setpoint out of
# lat_accel_request_buffer. But op_stream replaces modeld, so the model's OWN
# action_t input came from here -- and at 0.175 the model was planning its
# command for 100 ms sooner than the rack can deliver it. The controller then
# compensated for a lag the model had not planned around, which is the phase
# split that produced the 1.8 Hz limit cycle (torque crossing zero 1.84 times/s
# against a command crossing 0.87 times/s).
# OP_STEER_DELAY is the ONE place the lateral delay is set. It used to be split:
# this file hardcoded 0.20 here (-> LAT_ACTION_T 0.275) while controlsd took
# CP.steerActuatorDelay (0.20) + LAT_SMOOTH_SECONDS (0.0) = 0.200. Two different
# compensations for the same physical lag, and neither matched the loop: the
# measured limit cycle runs at 1.37 Hz, a 0.365 s half-period, so the real
# lag through camera -> model -> rack -> yaw -> camera is ~0.365 s.
# Under-compensated phase at this gain is what sustains the oscillation.
#
# interface.py:60 already says 0.2 is "the rack's lag alone ... a floor rather
# than a fitted optimum" -- the wheel-to-lateral-accel response is the rest.
# dashcam_web reads the same env var for liveDelay.lateralDelay, so the two
# sides can no longer disagree. Raise toward 0.30 to close the phase gap.

# --- manual mount trim, degrees, applied ON TOP of the learned calibration ----
# OP_CALIB_TRIM_DEG="roll,pitch,yaw". Defaults to no trim.
#
# Why this exists: op_calibrate learns roll/pitch/yaw from the model's own pose
# odometry, and that is the right correction for a rotated mount -- but it CANNOT
# see two things that both put the car off centre:
#
#   1. the camera being mounted off the vehicle's centreline. The model centres
#      the CAMERA in the lane, so a camera d metres left of centre parks the car
#      d metres right of centre, and pose odometry looks perfectly clean the
#      whole time (a lateral offset is not a rotation).
#   2. anything downstream that biases the car sideways at equilibrium -- road
#      crown, alignment pull -- since liveParameters.roll is published as 0 here,
#      so latcontrol_torque's roll compensation is inert.
#
# A yaw trim is the lever for both. It rotates the model's window, so the model
# perceives a lateral error it does not have and settles the car off its own
# notion of centre by roughly L_eff * yaw, with L_eff ~ 15-30 m (the path
# follower's heading/position gain ratio). At the +1 deg = 18.6 px scale of this
# camera that is ~0.26-0.52 m per degree. The car ends up PARALLEL to the lane
# and offset, not driving at an angle, so this is a position trim, not a hack.
#
# Sign: +yaw shifts the sampled window RIGHT in the source image, which moves the
# car LEFT in the lane. Trim AFTER calibration converges, never instead of it.
