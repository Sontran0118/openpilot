"""Record what the REAL radar puts on the bus when stock ACC activates.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Alpha long sends 0x21b/0x21c that are correct by every test we
can run offline: the DBC decodes them to the right signals, the checksums and
counters are right, they go out on both buses, the panda accepts them, the bus
ACKs them, and long_tx_err stays 0. MEASURED 2026-08-11 from a standstill with
the radar in software standby:

    0x21b = 01 ff e1 80 06 80 ..   ACC_ACTIVE=1  ACC_SET_ALLOWED=1  ACCEL_CMD=+2.0
    0x21c = 0a 01 0b 20 00 00 10 00   CRZ_ACTIVE=1
    longActive=1  enabled=1  accel=+2.00

and the car did nothing at all -- engine held idle at 646 rpm, no gas, no brake,
acc_active flat 0. Across every log this port has, acc_active=1 appears 769
times and ALL 769 have the radar transmitting. Not once from our own frames.

So the question is no longer "are our frames well formed" -- they are. It is
"what does the radar send that we do not", and nothing has ever captured the
former to compare against. Every hypothesis tried so far (frame content,
checksums, counters, bus coverage, suppression method, session type, DTC state,
SET button handshake, engagement ordering, replaying the radar's own captured
frames) was inference from the DBC, and all of them failed.

WHAT THIS DOES. Nothing. It transmits not one frame. It puts the panda in Mazda
safety with the longitudinal param CLEAR, which leaves bus 0 <-> bus 2
forwarding intact and the radar completely untouched, then listens. You drive
and engage cruise the normal way; FCW, AEB and SBS stay live throughout, which
also makes this the safest test in this project.

WHY NOT SAFETY_SILENT. nooutput_init() returns disable_forwarding = true, so in
SILENT the panda stops relaying the forward camera to the car entirely and the
cluster raises the front camera fault. Mazda-with-param-0 keeps forwarding and
grants no transmit authority we then decline to use.

Usage:
    stop both dashcam_web roles first (they own the USB handle), then
    python3 capture_acc_activation.py [--seconds 300] [--out FILE]

Then engage cruise: MAIN, get above the set-speed floor, press SET. The script
prints the 0x21b/0x21c bytes on either side of the acc_active 0->1 edge and
writes every frame to JSONL for offline diffing.
