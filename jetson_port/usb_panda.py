"""USB transport for the panda, replacing the serial one.

WHY THIS EXISTS. This port began on a Nucleo-F446RE whose only link to the Jetson
was a UART over the ST-Link VCP, so `SerialPanda` in bench_can_loopback.py
reimplemented panda's four wire operations over a framed serial protocol. The
board is now an STM32F407 (FK407M1) talking native USB, and there is no serial
device at all:

    /dev/serial/by-id/  does not exist
    /dev/ttyACM*        does not exist

find_panda_port() falls through all three by-id globs, returns /dev/ttyACM0, and
serial.Serial() raises on a node that isn't there -- so the whole stack died at
startup regardless of any flag.

This exposes the SAME four methods SerialPanda does, so dashcam_web only has to
change which object it constructs.

        # concatenated, and a lost byte is recovered by sliding one byte until a
        # candidate passes bus<=2, the address range and an 8-bit XOR. Those are
        # weak: a wrong alignment passes often enough that, on a bus this
        # repetitive, the parser can LOCK ONTO THE WRONG OFFSET and stay there --
        # it keeps finding "valid" packets forever, advancing by their length.
        #
        # That is not a stall and not a wedge, so neither existing watchdog can
        # see it: throughput is completely normal. MEASURED 2026-08-13 on a real
        # drive: can rx 2316/s before the failure and 2320/s after, while every
        # decoded value was garbage (rpm 8196, brake and gas both 1) for FOUR
        # MINUTES. Suppression stopped, lateral stopped, nothing was logged.
        #
        # THE DISCRIMINATOR. A real CAN bus carries a small, stable set of IDs --
        # 23 on bus 0 of this car. A wrong lock reads the payload bytes of one
        # packet as the header of another, so its addresses are essentially
        # random and the DISTINCT-ADDRESS COUNT explodes. That needs no prior
        # knowledge of which IDs are expected and self-calibrates to any bus.
